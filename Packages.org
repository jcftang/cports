#+TITLE: Erratas and Notes

* MPI
** OpenMPI
 - Preferred MPI Implementation

* GCC (and friends)
 - Generally prefer the system version of GCC unless it is absolutely
   required to use a newer version.
 - Should consistently use the same toolchain or you will have issues
   with fortran based apps and libs
  
* Bio Packages
** BioPerl
 - Works only with perl 5.12.1
 - Has build issues with 5.8.9
