hi. I haven't written this yet. See the FAQ for some info.

But just to give credit where credit is due... This ports system is a
fork of the (currently unmaintained) mpkg:

   http://staff.e.kth.se/mpkg/

I have mirrored that web site and put it in docs/mpkg-html.tar.gz. Please
see that for information on creating new ports, customizing and general
information.

Thanks,
Greg
