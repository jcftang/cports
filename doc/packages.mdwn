## MPI

### OpenMPI
 - Preferred MPI Implementation

## GCC (and friends)
 - Generally prefer the system version of GCC unless it is absolutely
   required to use a newer version.
 - Should consistently use the same toolchain or you will have issues
   with fortran based apps and libs
  
## Bio Packages

### BioPerl
 - Works only with perl 5.12.1
 - Has build issues with 5.8.9

## Table of apps that require specific compilers

The reference compiler is gcc 4.1.2, we assume all apps compile with
gcc 4.1.2 unless otherwise stated

[[!table data="""
| App           | gcc 4.3.2 | gcc 4.5.1 |
| stressapptest |           | x         |
| RDKit         | x         |           |
| abyss         |           | x         |
"""]]

## Table of apps that fail to build on certain systems

[[!table data="""
| App    | debian5.0 | sl5 |
| open64 | x         |     |
"""]]

## List of apps that are binary installs
