cports is a collection of Makefiles and macros for semi-automatic
builds of various pieces of software. It also uses
[environment-modules](http://sourceforge.net/projects/modules/) to allow
us to have multiple versions of software installed. Users can select
which versions they want to use with the module system.

cports primarily acts as documentation on how to build (some times
pretty complicated) pieces of software, so the stack can be reproduced
on different systems with some poking from the sysadmin.
