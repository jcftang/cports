## make <target>
### is equivalent to (using the install target): 

make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=debug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=real CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=c install

(so petsc defaults to a single module install of debug/real scalar/with c compiler)


So the other choices (stated using the  install target) are:

make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=debug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=real CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=cxx install
make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=debug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=complex CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=c install
make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=debug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=complex CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=cxx install

make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=nodebug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=real CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=c install
make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=nodebug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=real CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=cxx install
make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=nodebug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=complex CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=c install
make CPRT_PETSC_DEBUG=nodebug CPRT_PETSC_SCALAR=complex CPRT_PETSC_CCOMP=cxx install

There is an install script  (inst_script) which will do the above

There's an associated clean script which cleans up (clean_script)
which will do the above

Similarly there could be a test script/build script...

And of course the scripts could be made cleverer by looping, blah blah blah
 - done, see  generate_make_commands.sh
