The fact the emacs and in particular other packages set the INFOPATH shell variable seems 
to mess up emacs' ability to find its info files (because in cports, they are generally nonstandard).

It also messes up any setting of Info-default-directory-list in your .emacs or similar

This can be dealt with by setting the inherited value if INFOPATH to nil in your .emacs

e.g.,

(setenv "INFOPATH" nil) 

The extent to which this is correct (can you set an env var to nil?) or an awful hack is unclear to me, but it seems
to work
