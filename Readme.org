#+TITLE: cports - TCHPC fork

* Why fork cports
 - Needed more than just one version of gcc, intel, pgi builds of
   software
 - Needed more control with being able to add packages
 - Needed more variables put into the modulefiles

* What cports doesn't do 
 - It doesn't generate portable binaries
 - Provide good documentation on the modifications TCHPC has made
 - Support for people who use is :)
 - Dependancy and conflict checking of the packages, the admin who is
   writing the package will need to do this
 - Work with non-gnu based tools (it's a fork and the original authors
   used and based everything on gnu make etc...)
* Requirements
 - gnu make
 - gcc (and basic devel, compile tools etc...)
 - wget
 - environment-modules
* Systems tested on
 - ScientificLinux 5.x
